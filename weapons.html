                            The Gauss Cannon is a powerful and incredibly accurate weapon that fires steel flechettes (metal spikes essentially) at extremely high velocities using a magnetized chamber. Most enemies can be killed with one shot, though larger enemies, such as the Cacodemon and Baron of Hell, require more shots to kill.

                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            Based on the description and characteristics, the Heavy Assault Rifle is more like a heavy machine gun than an assault rifle by early 21st century standards. It fires from a closed bolt, but is belt fed. Additionally, it is stated that it fires a .50 caliber FMJ round. Judging by the cartridge's appearance, it is roughly equivalent to the .50 BMG round, which has historically only been used for heavy machine guns and sniper/anti-material rifles. Its size and power might explain why it has been supplemented by the Plasma Rifle. However, at least some UAC soldiers utilize a form of power armor, which might allow a single user to fire the high powered, high capacity gun as if it were an assault rifle, and the Doom Slayer in his Praetor Suit is more than capable of doing the same.

                        <h3>DOOM Eternal</h3>
                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            The Heavy Cannon is a weapon in Doom Eternal. It is functionally similar to the Heavy Assault Rifle seen previously in Doom (2016).

                            As before, the modifications available are either a precision scope for long-range fire, or a micro-missile launcher which launches small missiles with a narrow seeking angle: these explode with a small amount of splash damage a short time after impact. The scope functionality has been changed somewhat since the previous game, however: it is a drastically slower single-shot mode, and uses six ammunition per shot when aimed.

                            The micro-missiles are essentially the same, save that there are now launchers on both sides of the barrel for a total of 12 shots between loading pauses. There is no longer an upgrade to reduce ammo consumption, as this has been replaced with a new "Primary Charger" upgrade. With this, a kill with standard gunshots from the Heavy Cannon (with the Micro Missile mod equipped) will supercharge the weapon, causing it to glow red for five seconds. In this state missile damage is increased by 30%: with the "Bottomless Missiles" Mastery, this results in the Heavy Cannon being able to deal more damage per second than the Chaingun in Mobile Turret form. Additionally, the micro-missiles can damage the Doom Hunter even when the shield is on.

                            The Combat Shotgun is a returning weapon in Doom Eternal. It has modifications similar to the one in Doom (2016), except it launches up to three timed sticky grenades for the first mod (Five Spot enables up to five), and the second mod turns the shotgun into a full-blown full-auto Gatling shotgun.

                            The Super Shotgun is a weapon featured in Doom (2016).

                            It's a traditional style double barreled, break action shotgun which holds 2 shots at a time which cannot be fired independently (unless upgraded). It's more powerful than the Combat Shotgun but requires frequent reloads due to the small capacity. Unlike most weapons, no modifications can be added to the Super Shotgun, though specific improvements can be made.

                            The Super Shotgun returns in Doom Eternal, being the 5th primary weapon obtained in the campaign.

                            The Super Shotgun functions mostly the same as its counterpart in Doom (2016). However, it has an additional feature in the form of the Meat Hook. This functions as a grappling hook, allowing the Doom Slayer to grapple onto enemies and drag himself towards them for a devastating close-range blast. Unlike other weapons, the Super Shotgun lacks additional mods, and the only one it has is permanently attached. However, improvements can be made.

                        <h3>DOOM 2016</h3>
                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            Plasma Rifle is a weapon featured in Doom (2016).

                            Based on an early 21st-century high-intensity plasma gun design, it has been enhanced with Argent energy technology developed at the UAC Mars Base. After these enhancements, it has become standard-issue equipment for many militaries and has obsoleted the heavy assault rifle. Its plasmoid projectiles cause damage through both kinetic and thermal energy. It has a high rate of fire, emitting small bright blue discrete spheres of plasma. Unlike previous versions of the weapon, the plasma spheres have a small blast damage effect. This can be substantially increased through the use of the weapon's modified firing mode - a single larger plasma orb will be emitted which detonates in air, covering the nearby area in burning napalm-like plasma for a short period.

                            <b>Stun Bomb</b>

                            This modification condenses multiple plasmoids into a single pulse. The resulting discharge exceeds the Franheiser limit, creating a string of Birkeland currents. The resulting filamentary structure will incapacitate any target caught within the radius for a few seconds. This modification requires cooling between uses.

                            <b>Heat Blast</b>

                            A copper crucible attached to the focusing lens of the Plasma Rifle absorbs residual thermal energy from the weapon and can discharge it instantly by transferring the heat to a borosilicate diffusion chamber. This creates a heat wave from the end of the weapon that causes localized damage and sometimes creates a pressure wave that will knock back targets. The crucible recharges with normal use of the weapon. While the operator of the weapon is partially shielded from the charge, it is recommended that a thermal protection uniform (such as the X suit prototypes) be worn while operating this modification.

                        <h3>DOOM Eternal</h3>
                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            Making a return in Doom Eternal, the Plasma Rifle (or UAC D-93 Model Plasma Rifle) has undergone a redesign. It's now very similar in appearance to the Plasma Gun from the classic games and looks much bulkier when compared to the 2016 version, which resembles a bulkier version of the one featured in Doom 3.

                            The primary fire is essentially the same as before, a machine gun with slightly slower-moving projectiles that need to be led on distant targets, but is much stronger than it was before: one of its mods is an altered version of one from the previous game, while the other is entirely new.

It is standard issue to Heavy Weapons Specialists in all military forces due to its unparalleled direct impact and radius damage. The UAC improved the design slightly by adding an automated quick reload. The weapon casing has been retrofitted to accept UAC developed modifications."

                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            The Rocket Launcher, also called the Paingiver, is a weapon in Doom Eternal. It has been redesigned from its previous incarnation, to be based on the UAC Cultist and even the Doom Hunter's arm cannon.[1] Its remote-detonation mod and lock-on burst return from Doom 2016, but they appear to function differently in terms of upgrades and mastery.

                            Comparatively to its previous counterparts. The rocket launcher does a heavy amount of damage with both impact and splash being increased. Less ammo is carried, With it topped off at 13 rockets max making constant resupplies required.

                            The Siphon Grenade is a grenade that leeches health away from enemies to replenish the thrower, first acquired in the level Lazarus Labs. It creates a short-duration dome-shaped field which deals damage-over-time to all enemies within it, with all such damage being transferred over as health. It is an equipment item, and recharges after use.

                            When combined with the Equipment Power Rune, the rate of health restoration is increased and the Siphon Grenade gains the ability to fill up the Slayer's armor once health is fully replenished. This makes it extremely valuable when combined with the Rich Get Richer Rune, and far more effective in combination with this Rune than using Armored Offensive.

                            Delta-12 Chaingun, or simply Chaingun, is a weapon featured in Doom (2016). Serving as a heavier-duty alternative to the Heavy Assault Rifle, the newest incarnation of the classic weapon features an extremely high rate of fire with its famous six-barreled design.

                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            The Chaingun returns to Doom Eternal with a new look. It no longer requires a spinup time to fire at maximum speed, and it uses the same ammo type as the Heavy Cannon.

                            Its Mobile Turret mod also returns to the fray, only it has four sets of barrels for maximum firepower. The turret stalls if it overheats. It also has an Energy Shield mod that absorbs damage for a short time. For the Mobile Turret mod, it seems impossible to actually make the weapon overheat when in turret mode, as shown by <a class="remove-decoration txt-white" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbw2Sxt0w3c" target="_blank">this</a> video.

                            It allows the player to trigger a unique glory kill on a demon (provided that they have enough fuel). Small demons like the Possessed or Imps only require 1 fuel to kill, larger demons like Revenants or Pinkies need 3 fuel and finally Barons of Hell and Mancubi need 5 fuel. Demons killed by the chainsaw will drop large amounts of ammo, almost immediately refilling all ammo. As such, the most intuitive time to use the chainsaw is when the player is low on ammo. However, the chainsaw can alternatively be used to instantly take down a high-priority threat like the Mancubus, which is viable as there are runes like Rich get Richer and Ammo Boost and as the Slayer can get ammunition from even non-chainsaw kills when low on ammunition.

                            The chainsaw starts out with a capacity of three fuel, but can be upgraded when the player uses an Argent Energy Cell to upgrade his ammo capacity, with each cell upgrading the capacity by one.

                            The chainsaw's brand is "Painsaw," which may be seen written on the body of the saw.

                        <h3>DOOM Eternal</h3>
                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            The Chainsaw is a returning weapon in Doom Eternal. It functions the same as before, ripping and tearing open enemies to spill ammo and guts. The difference is that it automatically refills 1 gallon after being fully depleted, and it holds only 3 gallons (originally up to 7 in Doom 2016), but its low fuel count is made up for in brutality. Fodders and the Tentacle take one pip to chainsaw, Heavies take three, whilst Ambients other than the Tentacle and Super Heavies cannot be chainsawed.

                            The Chainsaw is much more integral to the gameplay than its predecessor in Doom 2016: while it is weaker compared to its predecessor, the Slayer has very limited ammunition resupply options in Doom Eternal, limited only to pickups and shotgun shell resupplies from killing units with a fully upgraded Full Auto Mod outside the usage of the chainsaw.

                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            The Hologram is a handheld device that, when thrown, will display a hologram of the Doom slayer armed with a Plasma Gun to distract enemies. However, whilst the hologram can fire the weapon to further illustrate its illusion, the weapon cannot damage enemies. It is first acquired in the level Argent Energy Tower. It is an equipment item, and recharges after use.

                            Since a distracted enemy will engage the Hologram even if the Slayer moves closer to them, it is particularly useful against enemies such as Pinkies and especially Possessed Security, as the latter will point their shield at the decoy.

                            When used with the Equipment Power Rune in effect, the decoy gains the ability to deal damage to enemies: in addition, the Rune makes Holograms last longer. When Mastered, the Hologram will not be destroyed if an enemy attacks it directly.

                            The Hologram is also usable in multiplayer in an attempt to fool enemy players. The hologram here functions slightly different from its singleplayer counterpart, as it will first run forward when activated while firing its weapon (still doing no actual damage, only being for aesthetics); it can then be controlled to stop running and stand still.

                            The Union Aerospace Tactical Division V-ORT.X Rifle, also known as the Vortex Rifle, is a sniper weapon that fires a burst of energy. It charges the longer the scope is in use, dealing critical damage when fired. A downside of the scope zoom is that a laser sight displays where the player is aiming; this laser sight can be seen by both friendly and enemy players.

                            <b>Primary Fire</b> - A precision long-range energy weapon with a magnified optic. The weapon does 30 damage.
                            <b>Weapon Mod</b> - Increases magnification and charges to full power output (Hold the Weapon Mod button). When at full power, the weapon does 84 damage on normal body shots and 120 on a headshot.

                            This gun can be considered an upgrade to the original EMG because of its increased damage and really fast bullet speed, but it could also be considered a downgrade because it no longer has infinite ammunition which is what made the EMG special.

                            The Static Rifle, also known as the Static Cannon, is a weapon featured in Doom (2016).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
                        <p class="ws-pre">
                            The Static Rifle can be unlocked in the multiplayer at level 16. The weapon was introduced into the game to help discourage camping tactics, thanks to its unique charging method. As the wielder moves around, the weapon charges up and increases in power; however, if the player stays idle, the weapon's charge drains. The player spawns with 12 ammo (20 is the max ammo). The weapon features two fire modes:

                            <b>Primary Fire</b> - A single shot. The weapon does 20 damage, but can do 60 damage or 79 precision damage when fully charged.
                            <b>Weapon Mod</b> - Zooms the weapon for better precision at long-range (Hold the Weapon Mod button).

                            The Reaper is a multiplayer-only weapon introduced in the Hell Followed DLC. It's a gun that unleashes six-round bursts of Hell energy, and has a weapon modification that allows it to charge up a shot for increased damage. It was recovered directly from Hell, and unleashes tortured souls that annihilate opponents. It appears to be designed similar to the Unmaker from Doom 64.

                            The front end of the weapon has four claws which are normally spread apart, but can contract together to focus the weapon's energy when it is charged. The weapon features a vaguely insectile appearance, especially on its back end, which resembles an arthopod's cerci. The skull inside the weapon is covered by a thin transparent membrane, and its aura changes from blue to orange when the weapon is fired.

                            The Threat Sensor is a device in Doom (2016) that, when thrown, attaches to a surface and highlights enemies within its radius. Both allied and enemy players can hear it beep when they are nearby, and it can be destroyed with weapons fire. It is a multiplayer-only equipment item, and recharges after use.

                            It is unknown why it takes so long to unlock (level 38) when it is basically just a weaker Threat Pulse. Thankfully, it does have at least one upside, which is that it can scan an area for far longer than Threat Pulse.
